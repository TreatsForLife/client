# Instajam

Instajam is a JavaScript wrapper for the Instagram API. You provide the access token, we provide the jam.

(And Instagram provides the gram. Or the pictures. Or... whatever.)

## Documentation

## Contributing

Contributions, fixes, or work on a test suite is welcome. If you are fixing a bug, please open an issue first with details on how to replicate the bug, and mention the issue number in your pull request.

### Developing

To work on Instajam you need to set up Grunt and install some Node.js packages. After cloning the repository, run these commands:

```
npm install
bower install
grunt watch
```

Grunt watches the Instajam source files for changes. When changes are made, Grunt runs JSHint  to validate the code, and, if successful, creates a minified version of the library in the ```dist/``` directory.
